Some of the conclusions we draw from our second experiment are the following:
- There was diversity among the users: different age-groups, gender, studies, work-field...
- Virtual Reality was known to all of them and most had previous experience with it. 
- The slope platform should be rocky/bumpy, so that it matches what the user sees in the virtual world. 
- The immersion breaks a bit when the user looks down and sees no feet. 
- The wind was in the correct position and added up to the experience. 
- The sound should be louder. 
- The users asked for smells. 
- There should be only one questionnaire, because the users got bored of so many questions.
- Having more computers for doing the questionnaires would have also been helpful. There were just two and people ended up in a qeue for filling in the questionnaires.   
- The keyboard of the computer was an issue, because most of the users were from Belgium, but the keyboard was from Spain and it didn't feel as comfortable for them to use (because the keys are not in the same place). 
- The language of the interface should better be in English, because until now it has been in Basque at it created some confussion among the users, who none understood Basque.
