## Introduction
For our second user test we collaborated with the Immersive Lab team from AP University. Every year the University organises Studium Generale. It is a lecture series that revolve around a central, socially relevant theme. They invite ten speakers to share their personal experiences, findings, reflections and ideas for the future with the audience. With this lecture series AP University encourages participants to reflect on current issues. Interdisciplinarity and social relevance are key in this respect. The Studium Generale lectures are open to all those interested and are held in Dutch or English. Each lecture is followed by a short debate with the audience.

On the 3rd of May the Immersive Lab prepared a tour to the Immersive Lab and we thought it was a great opportunity to get some new volunteers for testing our new environment. 

This user test differs from the previous one in that we tested the cliff rocky surface, which has a little slope. We also included the big ventilator for simulating wind coming from below.

The platform was constructed with a flat wooden board with some wooden blocks beneath supporting the structure. This material was taken from the Makerspace and the Immersive Lab of AP University.

## User-Test Journey
The users were divided into two groups and each one entered the experiment room separately. 

First of all, we explained them what our project was about. They then tested our VR experience one by one after some indications on how to use the headset. At the end of the experience, the users had to fill in three questionnaires: one with their personal details and their previous experience with VR, another one about the VR experiment itself and, finally, a feedback formular.
