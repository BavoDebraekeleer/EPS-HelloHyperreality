# **Touch Experience: Animals**
**- VR Environment**

> A natural environment with different animals where the user moves around and interacts with the animals. 

**- Real Environment**

> There will be some soft toy animals placed around the space and the user will move around touching them. 

**- Desired outcome**

> The user will feel more involved in the natural environment as she/he interacts with the elements in it. Using the sense of touch, she/he will feel as if she/he were interacting with the virtual animals. 


**NOTE:** this experiment can be done with a static or a moving user. That is, this environment can be experienced by both, people with reduced mobility and pepole with full physical mobility. In the case of the static experience, the toys should be manually placed in front of the user following the virtual experience.
