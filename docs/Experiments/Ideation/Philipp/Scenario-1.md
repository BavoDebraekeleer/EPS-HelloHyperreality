#Scenario 1

- ##VR-Environment: 
Forrest (tropical or moderate climate) with hanging plants growing down from the treetops   
- ##Real Environment: 
room with fake plants hanging from the ceiling in specific locations, synced with virtual representation
- ##Desired Outcome:
while walking through the virtual enviroment users will brush against the hanging plants in both the virtual and real environment. Touch sensations hopefully  lead to more immersion
