**VR Environment**
The user will be able to touch the different components that make up the world, for example, feel the touch of the bark of a tree, be able to touch the fur of an animal, touch flowers, be able to pick up things from the ground such as small or heavy stones, pick up a stick , that is to say that you can interact with each object you find and notice the difference from touching something soft to something harder.

**Real Environment**
Different types of stones could be placed on the ground, some heavier than others, some leaves from the trees and some sticks. A rug or something similar could be placed to simulate grass.

**Desired outcome**
The user will be able to distinguish the different types of objects that can interact around them
