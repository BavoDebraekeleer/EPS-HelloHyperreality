# Light in the Dark

An environment changes completely in how you perceive and navigate it depending on the time of day. Especially when it's in the dark at night with limited visibility.
When living in the city you never really experience complete darkness at night when you're outside.
This can be scary, but it can also be very southing if you know you're in a save environment.
There is way less of a sensory overload you experience outside during normal city life.
With a flashlight in hand you can focus your attention and the environment becomes more mysterious, in the sense that it's slower to explore because you don't see it all at once. It sparks curiosity, as well as a shift in sensory attention. You're more aware of sound or things you might bump into that our outside of your vision.

## VR Environment

Dark forest with a lake or a stream. Things that tell you what it is and where and how far it is just by sound, like water flowing.

## Real Environment

Some boxes to bump into that are represented in the virtual world by different things. Things that are low enough to be easily overlooked, but big enough to bump into, if only with your feet.

## Desired Outcome

Creating a different feel then daylight environments. Creating immersion with spatial audio.
Researching how different people react to this emotionally.
