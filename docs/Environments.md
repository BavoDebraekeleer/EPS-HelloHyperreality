As an end goal of the project a virtual reality prototype will be created for the Oculus/Meta Quest.
For this prototype a nature environment will be created consisting of:
- a beach,
- a forest,
- and a cliffside with cave tunnel connecting the two.

These will be separated into different scenes within Unity, but navigating through them will be a continuous experience for the user.

The development will run in parallel with the experiments to provide enough to be able to do the individual experiments, while building towards the complete environment for the prototype, incorporating what works according to our findings from the different experiments.
