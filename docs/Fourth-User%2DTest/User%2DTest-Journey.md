# **User-Test Journey**
- ##**Recruitment**
First of all, we set out to look for volunteers to test our VR experience. Our team created a Google Forms for people to select their prefered time-slot, between 12:00-16:00, to come to the Immersive Lab and try out our VR experience. This was sent via WhatsApp to all the EPS students and other AP international students. In total, 3 people signed up, but in the end, 10 turned up to our experiment.

We also created a quick guide for people to know how to arrive at the Immersive Lab, because for most of the students it is an unknown place.

- ## **Day of the Experiment**
The day of the experiment we went to the Immersive Lab and set up the VR equipment and physical surfaces.

For each user, we followed the following steps. 
>###**Explanation of the experiment**
>Once the volunteers were in the Immersive Lab, we explained the specifications and conditions of the experiment.

>###**Virtual Experience**
>Then, the users were immersed in an office-like environment, where the experience began. They were then teleported to other locations: a rainy forest, a cave, a cliff and a beach. 

>###**Questionnaire**
>After the experience, each user would fill out a questionnaire that gathered data about their profile and the VR experience. You can find the questionnaire link in the following section.

>###**Gift**
>Finally, for thanking the users their participation, they were given a home-made chocolate cookie.
