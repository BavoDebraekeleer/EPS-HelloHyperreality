**Conclusions and general recommendations**
- The experience should be long and guided. The users go through the experience very fast and can get bored easily if they don't know what to do. In our case, we guided the user with lights in the scene. 
- The wind helps in the immersion, but you also need wind-animation in the scene. 
- If you have physical platform with changing heights, it needs to be fixed and stable.
- Some people missed seeing their feet when stepping on physical platforms, but most didn't really mind. 
- If there is water in the scene, there will be users that would like to touch it and feel it. Nevertheless, we wouldn't recommend it, because the disadvantages of setting it up are greater than the advantages
- Different surfaces were really convincing; even a simple carpet was immersive. It is better when they are uneven, with some irregularities, such as rocks. 
- If there is any change of level in the ground (i.e. tiles or rocks to step on), there can be safety hazards when it's higher than 2cm. It all needs to match with the virtual environment, otherwise it can be risky for the user. 
- There are people who are not stopped by the boundaries of the environment. If they can still see above objects, they will try to go to the other side. The sight of the user should be blocked above eye level if they are not supposed to cross a boundary. Any safety-hazard must be represented in the virtual environment.
- It was very immersive to have a dark environment where you needed to point a flashlight to see more clearly, but it would probably be best to leave the other hand free, so that the user can also touch physical things. Nevertheless, it was also good that they couldn't touch with the hands, just in case what they touched didn't match their expectations and the immersion broke.
- The physical boundaries we now have don't really add to the immersion, but is mainly to make set-up easier and keep the sand inside the boundaries. However, it should be a bit lower, to avoid the user from triping. 
 
**Suggestion for further research**
- An idea would be to test how big an object must be for the user not to try to cross it.
- It would be a good idea to give users a layout of the different locations before the experience starts, to test whether this helps users navigating the environment and realise its a connected whole. Also they could test whether it is useful to show people where do they come from in each scene or it is better to create closed-up locations so they dont go the wrong way.
