Some of the conclusions that we draw from our fourth user-test are the following:
- Only 3 people signed up, but in the end 10 came. This is because students told to other students that they have liked our VR experience. This shows that the best way of getting our project known is people to talk about it to other people. 
- Nobody had any problem with being recorded.
- Men and women took part in equal amount in the user-test.
- It was the first time we had a lecturer testing our environment.
- Our user-tests have been the only VR experience of some users. 
- It was the first time someone stated having used VR for class; it was Anatomy class. 
- Although this time we used all the physical assets at the same time, most of the users felt safe, because what they were seeing accurately matched what they were physically feeling.
- The light-arrows were a good guidance for users to navigate the environment. 
- The flashlight was very useful and immersive
- Some people noticed smells, although this was not very strong. 
- A big tree trunk and more tree branches hanging would have been a good add-on. 
- We tried to create some physical walls for the cave, but couldn't. Nevertheless, some users did actually feel these walls were necessary. 
- The users felt relieved when they arrived at the sunrise, after they had passed through the dark cave. This shows that the effect of darkness plays a great role in the immersion of the user.
- Also, the fear of falling in the cave-hall was also very immersive.
- Users keep asking for water.
