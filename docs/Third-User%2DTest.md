In this section we will document the third user-testing we did on the 5th of June, 2023, in the Immersive Lab at AP Hogeschool. 

The headset we used for the experiment was the Oculus Quest 2. We used our own virtual environment, designed by Bavo Debraekeler.

This experience differs from the previous one in that we used a completely different scene and we have recreated different surfaces, aling with wind. The surfaces consist of a grass-like carpet, tiles that represent flat rocks and sand.  

The aim of this experiment was:  
- To test the implementation of different surfaces and see how this affects their immersion experience.
