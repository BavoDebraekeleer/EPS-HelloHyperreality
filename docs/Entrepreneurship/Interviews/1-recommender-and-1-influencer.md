# **INFLUENCER INTERVIEW**
In our case, influencers are people who influence companies to invest in our research. We came to the conclusion that the main influencers of our project would be the Immersive Lab at AP Hogeschool.
For our interview we met with multiple staff members from the Immersive Lab to pick their brains about the latest developments in VR, what they think the current immersive technologies have to offer for users and developers and also what they think about the research we are going to conduct during our stay in Antwerp. 
- One thing very important to them was the emotional component of our VR experiences. They really challenged us to think about what kind of emotional response we want to elicit in our users and how we can trigger these emotional reactions using our environment.
- They are interested in the social applications more than in the game applications of VR.
- Another thing they are excited about is the launch of a new smell delivery device to stimulate the olfactory sense of users. Maybe, if the Immersive Lab team can get their hands on it, it could be a great technology to research within one of our experiments.



# **RECOMMENDER INTERVIEW**
The recommenders of our project are the users that have tested our technologies. This means the volunteers who have taken part in the experiment and that can tell other people about how immersive our experiences are. 

For our interview we have contacted Awais, a student from the EPS programme and asked him about his thought on our Immersion Experiments.

When we asked him what he thinks the most important part of a immersive experience is, he told us his thoughts about interaction design and the gameplay. He said that the experience has to offer entertaining and engaging interactions with the virtual world for users to be immersed in it and that it is important to him to have fun when trying a VR experience.   
He said he is very enthusiastic about VR and the possibilities it offers and he would like to take part in all of our future experiments.
