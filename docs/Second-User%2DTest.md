In this section we will document the second user-testing we did on the 3rd of May 2023, in the Immersive Lab at AP Hogeschool. 

The headset we used for the experiment was the Oculus Quest 2. We used our own virtual environment, designed by Bavo Debraekeler. 

The aim of this experiment was double-fold: 
- To know the extent to which test-users are familiar with VR and see how this affects their immersion experience. 
- To test the implementation of wind and a slope in a VR environment and see how this affects their immersion experience.
