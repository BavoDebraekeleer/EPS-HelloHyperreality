# 3D Assets

## Sources

### Photogrammetry

For the majority of the environment we will be using photogrammetry 3D assets. These are real life objects that are scanned and reconstructed from photographs into 3D models. Our main source will be Quixel Megascans.

Own creation of 3D models will also used for experiments.
Certain iPhones and iPads have build-in LiDAR scanners and software to 3D scan things and rooms.
Specifically for creating 3D photogrammetry models to use in game engines there exists a software called RealityCapture. They also have an iOS app calles [RealityScan](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/realityscan-is-now-free-to-download-on-ios), which will be used in this project.

### Trees

Trees are very complex and a certain variety is needed for a forest to be convincing for the user.
It is very time consuming to model your own trees, but luckily there is software available that handles 3D model generation of trees while still providing a lot of customisation.
The SpeedTree package will be used in this project.
