Some of the conclusions we draw from our first experiment are the following:

- VR was known among the users. 
- The experience was too short in time to make the user feel really immersed.
- The experience should include more interaction with the environment, for example: a story-line. Some of the users were very fast in discovering the environment and got bored easily.  
- The ventilators were not successful enough in making the user feel more immersed; more and more intense stimulus should be included. 
- Working with the controllers was not difficult, but the wire of the headset did disturb the users. 
- The sound was very effective. 
- The overall set up and organisation of the experiment was correct according to the users.
