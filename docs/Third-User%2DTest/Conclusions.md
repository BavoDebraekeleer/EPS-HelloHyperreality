Some of the conclusions that we draw from our third user-test are the following: 
- It was the first time that one person didn't know what VR was. 
- Many students had experience with VR thanks to our user-testings, so we are contributing to getting people familiar with this technology. 
- The visuals were realistic and people felt safe using our physical platform. 
- Not everyone understood that they had to follow the lights, so more guidance will be needed for the next user-test. 
- The majority didn't feel disturbed by the fact that they couldn't see their feet in VR, so this may not have affected their experience too much. 
- The wind was not strong enough. 
- Nearly half of the users kind of forgot that they were in a laboratory and most of them, at some point, did feel quite like if they were in a real forest. Most of the users didn't consider taking their headset off and also half of the volunteers had a stronger feeling of being in the virtual world than in the real one. This proofs that there was high immersion in this experience.
- Half of the users felt they could fall into the lake and three quarters of them actually wanted to step into it. There were also suggestions to add water to the experience. Therefore, it is apparent that adding water would significantly heighten the immersion.
- There were some suggestions to change the umbrella for another thing, such as a stick. 
- The feedback shows that the team performed well and that it was a positive experience for the users.
- There were three people asking for more questions, whereas just two wanted less and three felt indifferent about it. Maybe we should consider adding more questions that measure other aspects of the immersion or new physical inputs that we may add in future user-tests.
