**VR Environment:**
The user will notice when he is walking on different types of grounds, whether it is less hard like beach sand or harder like cement. In addition, scenarios such as a wet floor that invites the user to slip or a muddy area could be implemented. Here are some ideas:
Walking on sand, stones, wet ground, snow, quicksand, if you go barefoot you could notice if the ground is hot or cold, that your feet sink, etc.

**Real environment.**
It could simulate walking on a mattress, pillow for softer areas. You could put small stones or objects so that the footsteps are noticeable that the ground is not flat, you could put salt so that the ground slips.

**Desired outcome**
The user will have the sensation of walking on different types of grounds.
