#Introduction

Generative AI tools can be very handy in the ideation fase of creative work.
It can be viewed as an extra thinker on the team coming up with it's on ideas depending on the topic or description you give it.
It can also be an easy and fast tool for idea visualisation. The result it gives you can be very different from what you expected to get or what you had in your mind, but that is part of the creative spark it can provide.
Here it's mostly the text to image generation that can provide the most value.
To come up with innovative ideas the LLM chat AI's are less useful, because they mostly reproduce existing ideas.

# Coming up with the experiments

The first thing that had to be decided on this project is what experiments would be conducted. For this we first did individual brainstorming to then bring those ideas together in a team brainstorm.
Here was an opportunity to use generative AI for both coming up with ideas as well as visualising ideas to be able to present them more clearly to the group.

1. Idea generation with Large Language Models
2. Idea visualisation with text to image AI tools

# Visualising the environments

3. Visualising the beach environment
