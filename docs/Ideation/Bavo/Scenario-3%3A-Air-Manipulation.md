# Air Manipulation

The Air Manipulation experiment focusses on sensory inputs that can be manipulated by changing the air around the user. For example:

- Air humidity: damp vs dry
- Air temperature: heat vs cold, eg. directional heat from the sun, icy wind, cool breeze, hot air
- Air pressure(?): open space vs enclosed cave

## VR Environment

Depends on the feel you want to test.

## Real Environment

Have things around to manipulate the air parameters, eg.:

- Electric heater or hair dryer to create directional hot air.
- Water spray or vaporizer to humidify the air.

## Desired Outcome

Heighten immersion by giving the user sensory inputs on their skin.
Letting them enjoy the experience more, eg. the warmth of the sun on your face, or the refreshing feel a drizzle can have on a warm day.
