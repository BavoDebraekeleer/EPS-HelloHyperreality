# Tight Spaces

Tight Spaces is a continuation of the last environment scene in the [Portals().Rebirth](https://sidequestvr.com/app/12836/portalsrebirth) project where the user has to crawl through a canyon towards the light. By making the environment so narrow and tight the user gets more immersed by actually needing to adept with their physical body to the VR environment.

Now if the user's head moves through the walls of the cave their vision goes black to show their inside the walls. This however breaks immersion and can confuse users. Better would be to make the real environment the user is in mimic the virtual environment, so the user is actually limited in their movement.

## VR Environment

Cave or canyon type of environment where the user gets limited in their movement and have to physically adept to it to navigate through it. Both by crawling down and up, as well as sqeezing through tight spaces.

## Real Environment

The real environment the user is in has to mirror the virtual world in it's moving limited boundaries.
A cave wall can be an actual wall, but can also just be a heavy curtain. Something the user can tough and bump into, but not hurt themselves.
An added difficulty for the immersion is mimicking the touch and feel of the virtual world.

## Desired Outcome

Being physically limited in the virtual as well as the real environment should heighten the immersion.
Getting the touch and feel right is an extra.
It will be interesting to see how both these parameters influence immersion.
