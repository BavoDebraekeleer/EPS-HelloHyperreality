# **Touch Experience: Ground**
**- VR Environment**
> The user will walk around different natural environments: forest, beach, mountain, park...

**- Real Environment**
> The user will walk inside a limited space and the groung will be different depending on the virtual environment. For example: if it is a beach, the ground will be full of sand; if it is a forest, the ground will have soil, little tree brances, little stones... 

**- Desired outcome**
> The user will feel more inmersed in the experience, because what she/he feels under her/his feet matches what she/he is seeing in the virtual space. 

**NOTE 1:** Moving from one natural environment to another (for example, from beach to mountain) may take time, as the ground has to be changed. That is why it is preferable not to mix environments in the same experience. 

**NOTE 2:** This experience can only be done with people with physical mobility or that can be moved around a limited space (for instance, with a wheel chair).
