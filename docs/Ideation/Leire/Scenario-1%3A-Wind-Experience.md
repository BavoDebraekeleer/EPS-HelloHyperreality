**<H1>Wind Experience**

**- VR Environment**
>The user will feel being in the open air. The wind will have different intensities 
depending on the scenario: forest, seaside, cliff... The wind will also affect the temperature sensation.

**- Real Environment**
>With the use of different sized ventilators (or just one and moving it around the place), emulate the wind, using various intensities and pointing from different directions. 
The direction of the wind can be simulated first in VR and 
the placement of the ventilator/s can be planned accordingly.

**- Desired outcome**
>The user will have the sensation of being in open air. He/she will feel the wind blowing in its face and will experience changes in temperature. 

**NOTE 1:** For a better immersion, as not to hear the sound of the ventilator/s, the user should wear headphones with sounds of the nature playing in it. The sound of the wind can be programmed so that it intensifies when the wind blows harder.  

**NOTE 2:** this experiment can be done with a static or a moving user. That is, this environment can be experienced by  both, people with reduced mobility and pepole with full physical mobility.
