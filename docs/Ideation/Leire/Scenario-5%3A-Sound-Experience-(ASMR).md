# **Sound Experience: ASMR**
The experiment consists of designing the audio recording for different natural environments with animals in it. In the audio the user will percieve the sound of some animals, but the intensity and direction of the sounds will vary.

For example, when you are in bed in summer and you start hearing a mosquito in your ear. You can't see it, but the sound of the insect coming back and forth tells you that the animal is there and really focus on it. 

The idea is to choose some animal sounds and play with them in the same way ASMR videos are made. For that, we can build our own Binaurial Dummy Head and make our recordings.

**- Desired Outcome**
>The audio recordings will make the user more immersed and actually feel (although just hearing) the presence of these animals.

**NOTE:** this experiment can be done with a static or a moving user. That is, this environment can be experienced by both, people with reduced mobility and pepole with full physical mobility.
