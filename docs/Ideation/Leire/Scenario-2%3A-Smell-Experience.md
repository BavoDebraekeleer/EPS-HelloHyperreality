**<H1>Smell Experience**

**- VR Environment**
>Being in an open space (forest, beach, river, park, garden) and smelling the scents found in those places. In the forest, the smell of wet soil and leaves; in the beach, the smell of salty-water and sand (and sun-screen); in the park, the smell of grass; in the garden, the smell of different flowers and vegetables or fruits. 

**- Real Environment**
>Typical scents found in nature will be bottled in a spray and spread in front of the user accordingly as it goes through the different scenarios. 

**- Desired outcome**
>The user will feel more immersed in the natural environment when what it sees matches what it is smelling. 

**NOTE 1:** the scents can be used in different ways (bottled up in a spray, placing the oobject/plant itself in front of the user while in the VR experience...)

**NOTE 2:** this experiment can be done with a static or a moving user. That is, this environment can be experienced by  both, people with reduced mobility and pepole with full physical mobility.
