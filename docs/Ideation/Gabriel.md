# **Scenario 1**

    • VR-Environment :

A path for walking surrounded by trees, with a wooden bench and a pond.


    • Real Environment :

Limited space with a real bench where the user can sit down to take a break and look at the environment.

    • Desired Outcome:

Once the user sits on the bench, a kind of scenario starts. They can see a squirrel walking in front of them, admire swans in the pond, or even feed birds. Like that, the user will feel as if he were outside, under a sunny day. A grass pad may be added so that the user can feel it when walking on the grass during the experiment.



# **Scenario 2**

    • VR-Environment :

A river where the user is on a canoe.




    • Real Environment :

The user sits in a real canoe and holds a paddle in his hands.

    • Desired Outcome:

Give the user the feeling of being on the water by placing the canoe on a support. Also create resistance when the paddle encounters the water, add kinds of foam trays to the right and left of the user. The immersion will thus be complete, and the user will be able to move forward in this world while remaining immobile. In addition, he will be able to watch animated fish below him.
