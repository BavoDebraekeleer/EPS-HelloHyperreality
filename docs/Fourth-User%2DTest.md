In this section we will document the fourth user-testing we did on the 13th of June, 2023, in the Immersive Lab at AP Hogeschool. 

The headset we used for the experiment was the Oculus Quest 2. We used our own virtual environment, designed by Bavo Debraekeler.

This final experience included all the scenes we had thought of: office, rainy forest, cave, cliff and beach with sunrise. It also consisted of physical stimulus such as surfaces (grass, rocks and sand), wind (with ventilator) and a bench.  

The aim of this experiment was:  
- To test all the scenarios merged
- To test the implementation of different physical stimulus and see how this affects the user's immersion experience.
