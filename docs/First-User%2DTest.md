In this section we will document the first user-testing we did on the 16th of March 2023, in the Immersive Lab at AP Hogeschool. 

The headset we used for the experiment was the HTC VIVE and we also used a pre-installed demo experience of a mountain landscape with a robot dog. 

The aim of this experiment was double-fold: 
- To know the extent to which test-users are familiar with VR and see how this affects their immersion experience. 
- To test the implementation of wind in a VR environment and see how this affects their immersion experience.
