## Introduction

This project is part of the [European Project Semester](https://www.ap.be/en/programme/european-project-semester-eps), or EPS, at [AP University of Applied Sciences and Arts Antwerp](https://www.ap.be/en/homepage), commissioned by, and in cooperation with, the [Immersive Lab](https://www.ap.be/en/researchgroup/immersive-lab).

The European Project Semester is an international program with the focus on inter-cultural and inter-disciplinary project work, which is reflected by the team composition.

The subject of  this project is **environmental immersion in a virtual reality nature experience**.
The aim is to research different ways to heighten the immersion of users in virtual reality experiences, specifically in *nature* environments, like for example a forest.
The research is done by conducting four user tests. The first used a demo for the HTC Vive called The Lab. For the other three self-build virtual environments were created with a matching physical real-world installation using the Meta Quest 2 as headset. The Unity project for these environment can be found in this repository.
